This repository contains the implementation and datasets for the study on virus-drug association prediction using ILRLSVDA methods. The project leverages three publicly available datasets to train and evaluate the proposed model.
The following datasets were utilized in this study:
1. Human Drug-Virus Database (HDVD)
Source: Literature-derived from HDVD (Reference 15).
Statistics:
455 drug-virus associations
219 drugs
34 viruses
2. VDA1 Dataset
Source: Curated from DrugBank (30), NCBI (31), and PubMed (32).
Statistics:
96 experimentally validated interactions
78 small-molecule drugs
11 viruses
3. VDA2 Dataset
Source: Experimentally validated associations (Reference 33).
Statistics:
770 drug-virus associations
128 drugs
69 viruses
For detailed statistics, refer to Table 1 in the manuscript.
