This repository contains the datasets for the study on virus-drug association prediction using ILRLSVDA methods. The project leverages three datasets to train and evaluate the proposed model.
The following datasets were utilized in this study:
1. Human Drug-Virus Database (HDVD)
Source: Literature-derived from HDVD.
Statistics: 455 drug-virus associations, 219 drugs, 34 viruses
4. VDA1 Dataset
Source: Curated from DrugBank, NCBI, and PubMed.
Statistics: 96 experimentally validated interactions, 78 small-molecule drugs, 11 viruses
5. VDA2 Dataset
Source: Experimentally validated associations.
Statistics: 770 drug-virus associations, 128 drugs, 69 viruses
For detailed statistics, refer to Table 1 in the manuscript.
